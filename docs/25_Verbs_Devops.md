## The 25 Verbs of DevOps: A Comprehensive Skills Framework

This briefing distills the webinar by Michael Forrester, "Mind the Gap: DevOps Skills Assessment Made Simple," integrating the **complete set of 25 DevOps action verbs** you to know in order to successfully deploy a technology for a commercial application. This framework is designed for technical leaders, DevOps engineers, and platform teams to systematically identify, benchmark, and close skills gaps for any technology adoption-from Kubernetes to IaC, ML Ops, and beyond.

### Why the 25 Verbs Matter

The pace of technological change (cloud, Kubernetes, platform engineering, AI/ML) has outstripped most teams’ ability to keep up. The 25 verbs represent the **core, repeatable actions** required to successfully launch, operate, and support any technology in production. They serve as a universal checklist for skills assessment, upskilling, and team maturity mapping.
Console based workflows ("clickops") don't scale with increasing complexity. You could hire a hundred Starcraft esports professionals and you still could not outclick the number of options you can acheive with infrastructure as code.

## The Four Pillars and the 25 Verbs

The verbs are grouped into four pillars, each representing a phase of the technology lifecycle. Mastery across all verbs ensures robust, production-ready DevOps capability.

### **1. Strategy (6 Verbs)**
- **Justify**: Build the business case for using a particular technology and articulate value.
- **Design**: Architect solutions, both high-level and tactical for implementing it.
- **Cost**: Estimate, track, and optimize costs (TCO, ROI) before deploying so that you know you can afford to operate the underlying infrastructure.
- **Productize**: Package as a service/platform for internal/external users. Developers, administrators and users need access to the same platform to know how it works.
- **Implement**: Plan and execute the rollout in small and manageable milestones.
- **Enroll**: Drive adoption of the technology through training, enablement, and change management.

### **2. Provisioning (8 Verbs)**
- **Build**: Automate builds (CI, pipelines, image creation).
- **Configure**: Apply configuration management (Terragrunt, Spacelift, Pulumi).
- **Deploy**: Automate deployments (Helm, Kustomize, GitOps).
- **Discover**: Enable service discovery and registration.
- **Distribute**: Handle replication, federation, and multi-region rollout.
- **Network**: Design and implement networking (CNI, service mesh, DNS).
- **Secure**: Implement access control, secrets, and compliance before deployment to production.
- **Store**: Manage persistent and ephemeral storage.

### **3. Operations (6 Verbs)**
- **Govern**: Develop accountability, policy, compliance, and guardrails.
- **Audit**: Track changes, access, and security events.
- **Document**: Maintain runbooks, code comments, and operational docs.
- **License**: Ensure legal compliance (open source, enterprise).
- **Maintain**: Patch, upgrade, and fix systems.
- **Perform**: Monitor and optimize for performance, scale, and SLOs.

### **4. Support (5 Verbs)**
- **Support**: Create support workflows (on-call, escalation, incident response).
- **Recover**: Plan for disaster recovery, HA, and backup/restore.
- **Monitor**: Implement observability (metrics, dashboards) not just monitoring.
- **Log**: Centralize and analyze logs.
- **Trace**: Enable distributed tracing and root cause analysis.

## The 25 Verbs Table

| Pillar        | Verbs                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strategy**      | Justify, Design, Cost, Productize, Implement, Enroll                  |
| **Provisioning**  | Store, Network, Build, Configure, Secure, Discover, Deploy, Distribute|
| **Operations**    | Govern, Audit, Document, License, Maintain, Perform                   |
| **Support**       | Support, Recover, Monitor, Log, Trace                                 |

## Applying the 25 Verbs: Example with Kubernetes

- **Strategy**: Can you justify Kubernetes for your org? Have you designed the cluster architecture? Do you know the costs (cloud, on-prem)? How will you productize it as a platform? Who will implement the rollout? How will you enroll and train users?
- **Provisioning**: Do you know how to configure persistent volumes? Set up CNI plugins and service meshes? Automate builds and configs? Secure with RBAC and secrets? Enable service discovery? Deploy with Helm/GitOps? Distribute across regions?
- **Operations**: Are there policies and guardrails (OPA, Kyverno)? Is auditing in place? Is documentation current? Are you compliant with licenses? Can you patch and upgrade clusters? Are you monitoring performance and scaling?
- **Support**: Is there an on-call and escalation process? Is DR tested? Are Prometheus/Grafana dashboards in place? Are logs centralized (EFK/Loki)? Is tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry) enabled?

## The 5-Level DevOps Competency Model

Each verb is assessed on a 1–5 maturity scale:

1. **Manual/Undocumented**: Ad hoc, clickops, inconsistent quality. FIguring it out as you go.
2. **Manual/Tribal**: Some consistency, but not documented, only in the heads of senior engineers.
3. **Process-Driven**: Documented, partial automation.
4. **Automated/Versioned**: Automated, version-controlled, industry best practice.
5. **Self-Healing/AI-Driven**: Fully automated, GitOps/AI, minimal manual intervention.

**Goal:** Most teams should target at least Level 4. Level 5 is increasingly achievable with automation and AI.
Engineers should never manually intervene in broken systems but fix issues in pipelines that restore a desired (working) system state.

## Skills Assessment and Upskilling Roadmap

- **Assessment**: You can use the 25 verbs to benchmark your (or your team’s) skills per technology.
- **Gap Analysis**: Visualize strengths/weaknesses (e.g., radar chart).
- **Roadmap**: Prioritize verbs/pillars with lowest maturity. Suggested sequence:
  - Weeks 1–8: Strategy + Provisioning (especially storage, networking, configuration)
  - Weeks 9–12: Operations (maintenance, performance)
  - Weeks 13–16: Remaining operations (governance, documentation, licensing)
  - Weeks 17–24: Support (observability, recovery, escalation)
- **Continuous Improvement**: Reassess regularly, especially after major tech or org changes.

## Best Practices and Industry Guidance

- **AI in DevOps**: AI is a force multiplier (Copilot, Cursor, LLM troubleshooting), but critical thinking remains essential.
- **Open Source First**: Where possible, favor open-source tooling for observability, automation, and platform engineering.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Prioritize scenario-based, hands-on labs for each verb. Implement learngins immediately.
- **Ecosystem Awareness**: The 25 verbs apply to every technology use case, use them to map not just skills, but also required adjacent tools (e.g., for Kubernetes: Helm, Istio, Backstage, Kyverno, etc.).
- **Adaptability**: The landscape is evolving (AI, platform engineering, ML Ops)-continuous learning is non-negotiable. What was typical in 2020 is behind the curve in 2025.

## Summary

The 25 verbs of DevOps provide a **universal, actionable framework** for assessing and closing skills gaps at the individual, team, or organizational level. Use them to drive upskilling, technology adoption, and production readiness-no matter what stack or ecosystem you’re working with. Regularly assess, automate, and iterate for continuous improvement and resilience in the face of rapid change.
