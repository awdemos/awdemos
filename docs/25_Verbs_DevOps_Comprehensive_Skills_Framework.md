# The 25 Verbs of DevOps  
### A Comprehensive Skills Framework for Successful Technology Deployment

Distilled from Michael Forrester’s webinar  
"Mind the Gap: DevOps Skills Assessment Made Simple"

**Objective:**  
Equip technical leaders, DevOps engineers, and platform teams with a framework to identify and close skills gaps.

---

## Why the 25 Verbs Matter

- Tech evolves rapidly: cloud, Kubernetes, AI/ML
- The 25 verbs = core, repeatable actions for launching, operating, and supporting tech
- Use as a universal checklist for skills assessment and team maturity mapping

---

## The Four Pillars & The 25 Verbs

- **Strategy**
- **Provisioning**
- **Operations**
- **Support**

Each pillar contains critical verbs ensuring robust, production-ready DevOps capacity.

---

## Pillar 1 – Strategy (6 Verbs)

- Justify
- Design
- Cost
- Productize
- Implement
- Enroll

*Focus: Build business cases, design architectures, drive technology adoption*

---

## Pillar 2 – Provisioning (8 Verbs)

- Build
- Configure
- Deploy
- Discover
- Distribute
- Network
- Secure
- Store

*Key: Automate builds, manage configs, ensure security*

---

## Pillar 3 – Operations (6 Verbs)

- Govern
- Audit
- Document
- License
- Maintain
- Perform

*Emphasis: Accountability, compliance, performance optimization*

---

## Pillar 4 – Support (5 Verbs)

- Support
- Recover
- Monitor
- Log
- Trace

*Importance: Support workflows, disaster recovery, observability*

---

## Example: Applying the Verbs to Kubernetes

- **Strategy:** Justification, design, cost analysis, productization, user training
- **Provisioning:** Configuration, service discovery, security, regional deployment
- **Operations:** Policies, documentation, licensing, monitoring
- **Support:** On-call, disaster recovery, centralized logging

## The 5-Level DevOps Competency Model

| Level | Description                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| 1     | Manual/Undocumented               |
| 2     | Documented/Repeatable             |
| 3     | Automated                         |
| 4     | Automated + Best Practices        |
| 5     | Self-Healing/AI-Driven            |

**Goal:** Achieve at least Level 4 automation and industry best practices

---

## Skills Assessment & Upskilling Roadmap

- Use verbs to benchmark skills and perform gap analysis
- Prioritize upskilling: sequential focus on each pillar (24 weeks)
- Continuous reassessment for improvement

---

## Best Practices & Industry Guidance

- AI as a force multiplier in DevOps
- Favor open-source tools, hands-on learning
- Stay adaptable in evolving tech landscapes

---

## Summary

- The 25 verbs = universal framework for skills assessment & tech adoption
- Drive continuous improvement and resilience amid rapid change

---

## Call to Action

- Adopt the 25 verbs framework
