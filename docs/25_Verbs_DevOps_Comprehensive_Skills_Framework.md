# The 25 Verbs of DevOps üèóÔ∏èüèóÔ∏èüèóÔ∏è
### A Comprehensive Skills Framework for Successful Technology Deployment

The following is distilled from Michael Forrester‚Äôs webinar
"Mind the Gap: DevOps Skills Assessment Made Simple" on how to define the job role of DevOps Engineers and list
what the areas of responsabilites are. 

**Objective:**
Quickly equip technical leaders, DevOps engineers, and platform teams with a framework on how to improve delivery of service.

---

## üö¶ Why the 25 Verbs Matter

- Tech evolves rapidly: cloud, Kubernetes, AI/ML
- The 25 verbs = core, repeatable actions for launching, operating, and supporting tech
- It can be seen as a checklist for skill assessments and teams operational maturity based on common patterns.

---

## üèóÔ∏è The Four Pillars and the 25 Verbs

- **Strategy**
- **Provisioning**
- **Operations**
- **Support**

Each pillar contains critical verbs ensuring robust, production-ready DevOps capacity.

---

## Pillar 1 ‚Äì Strategy (6 Verbs)

### **1. Strategy (6 Verbs)**
- **Justify**: Build the business case for using a particular technology and articulate value.
- **Design**: Architect solutions, both high-level and tactical for implementing it.
- **Cost**: Estimate, track, and optimize costs (TCO, ROI) before deploying so that you know you can afford to operate the underlying infrastructure.
- **Productize**: Package as a service/platform for internal/external users. Developers, administrators, and users need access to the same platform to know how it works.
- **Implement**: Plan and execute the rollout in small and manageable milestones.
- **Enroll**: Drive adoption of the technology through training, enablement, and change management.

*Focus: Build business cases, design architectures, drive technology adoption*

---

## Pillar 2 ‚Äì Provisioning (8 Verbs)

- **Build**: Automate builds (CI, pipelines, image creation).
- **Configure**: Apply configuration management (Terragrunt, Spacelift, Pulumi).
- **Deploy**: Automate deployments (Helm, Kustomize, GitOps).
- **Discover**: Enable service discovery and registration.
- **Distribute**: Handle replication, federation, and multi-region rollout.
- **Network**: Design and implement networking (CNI, service mesh, DNS).
- **Secure**: Implement access control, secrets, and compliance before deployment to production.
- **Store**: Manage persistent and ephemeral storage.

*Key: Automate builds, manage configs, ensure security*

---

## Pillar 3 ‚Äì Operations (6 Verbs)

- **Govern**: Develop accountability, policy, compliance, and guardrails.
- **Audit**: Track changes, access, and security events.
- **Document**: Maintain runbooks, code comments, and operational docs.
- **License**: Ensure legal compliance (open source, enterprise).
- **Maintain**: Patch, upgrade, and fix systems.
- **Perform**: Monitor and optimize for performance, scale, and SLOs.

*Emphasis: Accountability, compliance, performance optimization*

---

## Pillar 4 ‚Äì Support (5 Verbs)

- **Support**: Create support workflows (on-call, escalation, incident response).
- **Recover**: Plan for disaster recovery, HA, and backup/restore.
- **Monitor**: Implement observability (metrics, dashboards) not just monitoring.
- **Log**: Centralize and analyze logs.
- **Trace**: Enable distributed tracing and root cause analysis.

*Importance: Support workflows, disaster recovery, observability*

---

## Example: Applying the Verbs to Kubernetes

- **Strategy:** Can we justify the complexity, design, cost analysis, productization, user training of kubernetes?
- **Provisioning:** How do we do configuration, service discovery, security, regional deployment?
- **Operations:** Policies, documentation, licensing, monitoring
- **Support:** On-call, disaster recovery, centralized logging

## üìà The 5-Level DevOps Competency Model

| Level | Description                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| 1     | Manual/Undocumented               |
| 2     | Documented/Repeatable             |
| 3     | Automated                         |
| 4     | Automated + Best Practices        |
| 5     | Self-Healing/AI-Driven            |

**Goal:** Achieve at least Level 4 automation and industry best practices

---

## Skills can be Assessed and improved with an Upskilling Roadmap

- Decide which verbs to benchmark againsts skills in practice and perform gap analysis
- Prioritize upskilling: sequential focus on each pillar can happen in a structured program in as little as such as in 1 or 2 specialized training
- Continuous reassessment for improvement is a good thing! Getting continuous feedback from your customer is a good practicw found in Agile organizations and it remains relevant today.

---

## Best Practices & Industry Guidance

- AI is a force multiplier in DevOps and you should be using it well by now
- Favor free, low cost, and open-source tools, hands-on learning
- Stay adaptable in evolving tech landscapes

---

## Summary

- The 25 verbs = universal framework for skills assessment & tech adoption
- Drive continuous improvement and resilience amid rapid change

---

## Call to Action

- Adopt the 25 verbs framework
- Use printable checklists or team assessment templates
- Reach out to me if you would like a free AI readiness self-assessment.
