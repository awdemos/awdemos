Before diving into the concept of containers and its benefits for deploying applications today, let's consider the deployment methods existed before container technology became available. Historically, deploying an application involved setting it up on a physical server, requiring:

- Physical space
- Power supply
- Cooling systems
- Network connectivity
- Installation of an operating system
- Software dependencies
- And the application itself

When the need arose for more processing power, redundancy, security, or scalability, the solution was to add more physical servers, often dedicating each server to a single function like a database, web server, or content delivery network. This approach was resource-intensive, time-consuming, and lacked flexibility and portability, as applications were often tied to specific operating systems or hardware.

Virtualization technology marked a significant shift for online services, allowing multiple virtual servers and operating systems to run on a single physical server. This was made possible by a Hypervisor, a software layer that decouples the operating system from the underlying hardware. Virtualization offered quicker deployment times, reduced resource wastage, and improved portability, though it still bundled the application with its dependencies and the operating system, making it cumbersome to migrate virtual machines across different hypervisor platforms and causing slow boot times for the operating systems.

Virtualization also introduced challenges in running multiple applications on a single virtual machine as monolithic applications tend to share dependencies could lead to conflicts, and resource demands from one application could impact others. While strict software engineering policies and integration tests could mitigate these issues, they introduced new complexities and slowed down development.

A dedicated virtual machine for each application could solve some of these problems by isolating dependencies and ensuring that one application's performance wouldn't affect another's. However, this approach quickly becomes unsustainable at scale, with redundant copies of the kernel and slow startup times due to the need to boot the entire operating system for each VM.

A more efficient solution to the dependency problem lies in abstracting only the application and its dependencies, rather than the entire machine or operating system. This is achieved through containerization, which isolates the user space - the part of the system where applications and their dependencies reside, above the kernel. Containers offer a lightweight, efficient, and quick-to-start alternative to virtual machines, as they don't include a full operating system.

Containers have revolutionized application deployment by providing a lightweight, isolated, and efficient method for packaging and running applications. They allow developers to bundle their code with all necessary dependencies, with the container engine handling runtime requirements. This application-centric approach facilitates high-performance, scalable applications, and ensures consistency across development and production environments. Containers also support the microservices architecture, enabling modular and easily upgradable applications.

In summary, containerization represents a significant evolution in application deployment, offering a solution that is resource-efficient, portable, and conducive to rapid development cycles.
