## Kubernetes Debugging and Troubleshooting

### ImagePullBackoff Error
The `ImagePullBackoff` error indicates issues with pulling the container image from the registry, which could be due to:
- **Invalid Image/Tag**: Ensure the image name and tag in your pod's configuration match what's available in the registry.
- **Invalid Permissions**: If the image repository is private, verify that your Kubernetes cluster has the correct credentials to access it. Utilize image pull secrets for authentication.
- **Private Registry Access**: For private registries, confirm the registry URL is correct and reachable from within the cluster.

### RegistryUnavailable Error
The `RegistryUnavailable` error suggests the registry from which the image is being pulled is unavailable. To troubleshoot:
1. **Registry Status**: Check if the registry is operational.
2. **Network Connectivity**: Verify the network connection from your Kubernetes cluster to the registry.
3. **Network Policies/Firewall Rules**: Ensure traffic to and from the registry is allowed by any network policies or firewall rules.

### InvalidImageName Error
The `InvalidImageName` error indicates a problem with the format of the image name. To resolve:
- **Image Name/Tag Syntax**: Ensure the syntax is correct, e.g., `registry/user/image:tag`.
- **Existence in Registry**: Verify that the specified image and tag exist in the registry.

### CrashLoopBackOff Error
The `CrashLoopBackOff` error signifies that a pod is repeatedly starting, crashing, and restarting. Possible causes include:
1. **Liveness Probe Failure**: Review the liveness probe configuration for correct path, port, and initial delay settings. Adjust as necessary to allow more time for application startup.
2. **Application Startup Failure**: Inspect pod logs for application-specific errors. Ensure the application is properly configured for its deployment environment.

### KillContainerError
The `KillContainerError` can occur due to various reasons, such as resource constraints or manual intervention. Troubleshooting steps include:
1. **Insufficient Resources**: Verify that the nodes have enough CPU and memory to schedule the pod.
2. **Pod Readiness**: Check that all containers in the pod are starting correctly and review logs for errors. Confirm readiness probes are properly configured.

### DNS Resolution Problems

Pods failing to communicate with other services might be experiencing DNS resolution issues. Ensure the cluster's DNS service is functioning correctly. Here are steps to troubleshoot DNS resolution problems in Kubernetes:

1. **Check CoreDNS Pods**: CoreDNS is the default DNS service in Kubernetes. Ensure CoreDNS pods are running and healthy.

```sh
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep coredns
kubectl logs <coredns-pod-name> -n kube-system
kubectl describe pod <coredns-pod-name> -n kube-system
kubectl exec -ti <pod-name> -- cat /etc/resolv.conf #    The nameserver IP should match the CoreDNS service IP
kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep coredns

kubectl exec -ti <pod-name> -- nslookup kubernetes.default
kubectl get configmap coredns -n kube-system -o yaml


```

### General Troubleshooting Steps for Readiness Probes
- **Probe Configuration**: Verify the readiness probe configuration, ensuring endpoints return the expected HTTP status codes or responses.
- **Adjust Probe Settings**: Modify `initialDelaySeconds`, `periodSeconds`, and `timeoutSeconds` based on your application's startup behavior.

### Additional Troubleshooting Tips
- **Pod Details**: Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` for detailed information about the pod's state and events.
- **Application Logs**: Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to access application logs for insights into errors or issues during startup or operation.
