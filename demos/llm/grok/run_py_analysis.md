The `run.py` script is designed to initialize and run inference with a transformer-based language model. Below is an overview of its main components and workflow:

1. **Imports and Setup**: The script imports necessary modules and defines a context manager `copy_to_shm` for copying files to a temporary directory, which is cleaned up automatically afterward. This is particularly useful for handling checkpoint files.

2. **Checkpoint Path**: `CKPT_PATH` is defined as the relative path to the directory containing model checkpoints.

3. **Model Configuration**: The script configures a language model using `LanguageModelConfig` and `TransformerConfig`. These configurations include parameters such as vocabulary size, sequence length, embedding scales, and transformer-specific settings like the number of attention heads, layers, and experts for Mixture of Experts (MoE).

4. **Inference Runner Setup**: An `InferenceRunner` instance is created and configured with the model, checkpoint path, tokenizer path, and mesh configurations. The `InferenceRunner` manages the inference process, including loading the model and tokenizer, setting up the device mesh for parallel computation, and running the model to generate predictions.

5. **Model Inference**: The script initializes the `InferenceRunner`, runs it to obtain a generator, and then uses `sample_from_model` to generate a text sample based on a given input prompt. The output is printed to the console.

6. **Main Function**: The main function encapsulates the workflow described above and serves as the entry point of the script when executed directly.

7. **Execution**: The script sets up basic logging and calls `main()` if the script is run as the main program.

This script orchestrates the process of running inference with a transformer-based language model, managing everything from loading configurations and checkpoints to generating text based on an input prompt.
