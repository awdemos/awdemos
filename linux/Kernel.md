# Kernel

A kernel is the sotware that handles the data input and output of programs in the hardware of a computer. I have been a fan of it since first installing Red Hat 6.2 which I installed from a CD that came from a magazine I bought in a book store.

More information and important aspects of the Linux kernel for Devops and SRE (forthcoming).
