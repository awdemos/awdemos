# Fine-Tuning and Deploying a Machine Learning Model with Cog and Replicate

This guide provides the easiest possible step-by-step process for preparing and deploying a machine learning model using Cog and Replicate. It covers everything from prerequisites to pushing your model to Replicate's registry. This example is not suitable for production but the build, train, deploy lifecycle is inherent to MLOps. 


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

A trained model saved on your computer, including any necessary code for running it.
Docker installed and running on your machine. Verify Docker is operational by running docker info in your terminal.

(Optional) For GPU models: A Linux machine with an NVIDIA GPU and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed.

A Replicate account. Sign up at Replicate.

## Create a Model Page on Replicate

Visit Replicate's create model page.

Choose a name for your model and specify its visibility (public or private).

```
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/cog -L https://github.com/replicate/cog/releases/latest/download/cog_`uname -s`_`uname -m`
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cog

cd modelname
cog init # Initialize Cog

# don't run the following command if you want your model to be cpu only
sed -i 's/gpu: false/gpu: true/' cog.yaml

cog run python # test cog runs by starting python

cog predict -i image=@input.jpg

cog login
cog push r8.im/<your-username>/<your-model-name>
```

```sh
import replicate

result = replicate.run(
  "r8.im/<your-username>/<your-model-name>",
  input={"text": "example"}
)
```

## Conclusion

This guide walked you through the process of preparing, fine-tuning, and deploying a machine learning model using Cog and Replicate. For further details, consult the Cog documentation and explore more features on the Replicate website!
