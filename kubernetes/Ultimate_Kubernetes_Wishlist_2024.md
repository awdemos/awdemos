Here are some ideas I would like to use in my next engagements. I have spent countless hours researching, testing, and deploying every tool under the sun and these are my recommendations for containerized workloads in 2024.

This ultimate list is designed for minimalism, security, and latest trends.

## Base Infrastructure with Talos and Omni

- **Talos**: A modern OS for Kubernetes that provides a secure, immutable, and minimal environment for running Kubernetes. The OS is immutable, consists of only 12 binaries(!) and only knows how to run kubernetes. [Learn more about Talos](https://www.talos.dev/). 

- **Omni**: A tool for managing multi-cluster Kubernetes environments. [Discover Omni](https://www.omniproject.io/).

## Container Runtime and Security

- **Containerd**: I think containerd should replace docker for most containerized application developers since that is what will be running the containerized app in Talos. This manages the container life cycle and support for running containers according to OCI specifications. Ideal for running both general-purpose applications and specialized workloads like Large Language Models or Blockchain nodes. [Learn more about containerd](https://containerd.io/).

- **Kata Containers**: Use Kata Containers for workload isolation. Configure Kubernetes to use Kata as the container runtime for selected deployments. This is how I would run Large Language Models or Blockchain nodes in a cluster. [Explore Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/).

- **Chainguard Images**: Utilize Chainguard Images, which are minimal and secure container images. These minimal images ship with zero CVE's, are re-built daily, are based on Alpine Linux, immutable, contain no shell, and no package manager. [Check out Chainguard Images](https://chainguard.dev/products/images/).

- **Chainguard Enforce**: For enforcing policy and ensuring only trusted images are deployed. Turn "default allow" developer experience with Kubernetes into "default deny" production ready workloads. [Learn about Chainguard Enforce](https://chainguard.dev/products/enforce/).

## Enhancing Security with Sigstore

- **Sigstore**: Adopt Sigstore to improve the security of the software supply chain significantly. Sigstore offers a set of open-source tools designed to securely sign and verify software artifacts such as container images, binaries, and software bills of materials (SBOMs). By leveraging ephemeral signing keys and recording signing events in a tamper-resistant public log, Sigstore enables developers and consumers to ensure the integrity and origin of software artifacts without the cumbersome management of keys. [Learn more about Sigstore](https://docs.sigstore.dev/).

## Continuous Deployment and Configuration Management

- **Flux**: Use Flux for GitOps-based continuous deployment. Configure it to monitor your Git repository for changes and automatically apply them to your Kubernetes clusters. I like ArgoCD but Flux requires significantly less cognitive load to write and maintain.[Discover Flux](https://fluxcd.io/).

- **Pulumi Devcontainer**: Leverage the Pulumi Devcontainer for infrastructure as code, allowing you to define Kubernetes resources and infrastructure in a programming language. [Explore Pulumi Devcontainer](https://github.com/pulumi/devcontainer).

## Container and Image Management

- **Skopeo**: Use Skopeo for working with remote container registries, inspecting images, and copying images between registries. [Check out Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo).

## CI/CD Pipeline

- **Tekton**: Implement Tekton for building and deploying applications. Define Tekton pipelines for continuous integration and delivery workflows. [Learn more about Tekton](https://tekton.dev/).

## Source Code Management

- **Gitea**: Deploy Gitea as a lightweight self-hosted Git service. Use it for source code management in your CI/CD pipelines. [Discover Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/).

## Testing

- **Testkube**: Integrate Testkube for running tests on your Kubernetes resources and applications. [Explore Testkube](https://testkube.io/).

## AI

- **Chroma**: Utilize Chroma for an AI-native open-source embedding database. [Check out Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/).

- **k8sgpt**: Leverage k8sgpt for AI-driven Kubernetes management and optimization. [Explore k8sgpt](https://k8sgpt.ai/).

## Database and Data Management

- **CloudNativePG**: Use CloudNativePG for running PostgreSQL on Kubernetes in a cloud-native manner. It is either this or CockroachDB and I am electing for the simpler solution for development purposes. [Discover CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/).

## Machine Learning Operations

- **Zenml**: Integrate Zenml for managing machine learning pipelines. This framework looks like a winner for getting started with MLOPS quickly. [Explore Zenml](https://zenml.io/).

## Network Security and Performance

- **Cloudflare Warp**: Implement Cloudflare Warp for secure and fast network connectivity. I would like to use this to force all ingress traffic to the cluster through a private secure link with upstream loadbalancers. Follow the guide on Cloudflare's blog for setting up the Cloudflare Ingress Controller. [Learn about Cloudflare Warp](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp/).

## Event-Driven Autoscaling with KEDA

- **KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling)**: Integrate KEDA to enable event-driven autoscaling in your Kubernetes clusters. KEDA is a powerful tool that allows for the scaling of any container in Kubernetes based on the number of events needing to be processed. It supports a wide range of event sources and is designed to be lightweight and flexible, working alongside standard Kubernetes components like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. [Learn more about KEDA](https://keda.sh/).

## Network Policy and Security

- **Cilium**: Use Cilium for Kubernetes networking, security, and observability. Cilium's performance, service mesh, observability, and multi-cluster communication is what I am betting on in 2024. Refer to the Cilium documentation for setup and configuration. [Check out Cilium](https://cilium.io/docs/).

This design spec guide outlines a comprehensive approach to building a Kubernetes deployment leveraging modern tools and practices for security, deployment, CI/CD, and observability. Each component plays a crucial role in creating a scalable, secure, and efficient Kubernetes infrastructure.

## More Goodies
I have a few more suggestions based on requires including for GPT's, MLOPS, secrets management, and logging but I won't mention those here.
