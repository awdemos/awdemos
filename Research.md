## Ethereum

Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications. Here are some useful resources:

## Docker

Docker is a platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

## Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability.

The python based Dockerfile generator is included only a proof of concept but I think code generated Dockerfiles will eventually considered an industry best practice as human generated source files are more prone to bugs.

## Datadog

Datadog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications.
