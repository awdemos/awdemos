## Containers

I have a lot to add here eventually. Let's just start with ,y favorite labs environnment 

- [Explore containerd with iximiuz Labs Courses](https://labs.iximiuz.com/courses)
- [Linux Container Primitives: cgroups, namespaces, and more!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1npPrzyKfs)

## Docker

Docker is a platform that utilizes OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages known as containers. As of 2024, my tooling preferences have changed to use nerer tooling and I prefer using Podman and Nerdctl to do container work instead of Docker.

## Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability.

In the python directory there is a custom project I made that is a data vlidation input checker for a Dockerfile generator I hope to make more robust over time.

- [PyGit Source Code](https://github.com/benhoyt/pygit/blob/master/pygit.py) This is my favorite way to learn python and git.
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) I believe this is an underappreciated component of the python ecosystem more people should be using.
