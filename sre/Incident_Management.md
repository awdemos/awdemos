# Incident Management in SRE

## Understanding Incidents
An incident is essentially an unexpected event that disrupts normal operations or diminishes the quality of IT services. It could also be a configuration issue that hasn't yet affected services but has the potential to. Swift resolution of these incidents is crucial to maintaining service levels.

## Incident Lifecycle

ITIL back in 2011 defined an Incident as:

“an unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service or a failure of a Configuration Item that has not yet impacted an IT service [but has potential to do so]”

The lifecycle of an incident, as outlined by ITIL, includes several phases:

### 1. Identification, Logging, and Categorization
Incidents can be detected through automated monitoring systems or identified manually. Once detected, they are logged and categorized based on severity, functional area, and ownership to facilitate resolution. This process, traditionally managed by first-level technicians, is increasingly automated.

### 2. Notification, Assignment, and Escalation
This phase involves notifying the appropriate personnel to address the incident. Identifying the right responders and escalating to specialists or subject matter experts can be complex, but modern incident management systems streamline this with automation.

### 3. Investigation and Diagnosis
Responders gather information using observability tools and analyze past incidents for insights. This helps in hypothesizing the cause and determining a solution.

### 4. Resolution
The team implements the proposed solution, often requiring several attempts before the incident is fully resolved. Each attempt provides valuable feedback for refining the solution.

### 5. Closure
An incident is closed once normal service is confirmed to have resumed. Confirmation can come from various sources, including monitoring systems, development or operations teams, and end-users. Follow-up actions, such as a postmortem analysis, are crucial for preventing future incidents.

## The OODA Loop
The OODA loop, a concept from military strategy, is highly applicable to incident management. It stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act, emphasizing a continuous loop of feedback and action until resolution.

## Best Practices in Incident Management
Effective incident management relies on experience and structured approaches.

Key practices include:

- **Delegating Roles**: Assigning clear roles and responsibilities within the team.
- **Centralized Coordination**: Establishing a "war room" for centralized communication and coordination.
- **Maintaining a Live Incident Document**: Keeping a real-time record of the incident accessible to all team members.
- **Seamless Handoffs**: Ensuring smooth transitions between responders as needed.
- **Strategic Practices**: Implementing strategies that reduce recovery time and stress.
- **Postmortems and Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Conducting thorough reviews after incidents to prevent recurrence.

## Key Roles in Incident Management

In the realm of SRE, three pivotal roles are identified for managing incidents:

1. **The Incident Commander (IC)** is the person who is in charge of the incident.
2. **The Operations Lead (OL)** is the person who spearheads the investigation.
3. **The Communications Lead (CL)** is the person who is responsible for updating all stakeholders.

The OL and CL might involve additional team members for support, who then report back to them, while they, in turn, report to the IC.

Maintaining distinct roles is crucial to ensure the investigation remains focused and uninterrupted by frequent updates requests or the task of assembling a response team.

## Incident Declaration and Management

Not every alert escalates to an incident. Routine alerts with established playbooks can often be managed by the on-call SRE until such processes are automated. However, significant issues are treated as incidents, either at the discretion of the SRE based on the severity or if the issue remains unresolved within a set timeframe, affects multiple teams, or impacts customers.

An incident is officially declared once an IC is appointed. This could be the initially responding SRE or another SRE assigned to take command, allowing the first responder to focus on the investigation as the OL. Depending on the severity of impact the incident has on customers may be classified as minor or major.

The IC may assume the role of CL or appoint someone else to manage communications. Initial communication is facilitated through an incident document, a dynamic record that requires a collaborative platform for real-time updates accessible to all relevant parties.

As the situation evolves, the OL might engage additional resources, communicating through alternative channels like Slack or other messaging systems where automated updates can also be posted. The CL monitors these discussions to extract and relay pertinent information through the incident document and direct updates to stakeholders.

The IC has the final say in decision-making, whether it involves choosing between different solutions proposed by the OL or approving public statements suggested by the CL. These roles are not fixed and can be transferred to other SREs as shifts change, ensuring continuous management of the incident. The incident document plays a vital role in facilitating a smooth transition between commanders.

This structured approach to incident management clarifies responsibilities, streamlines the resolution process, and ensures consistent updates for stakeholders.

## Post-Incident Analysis

Once the issue is resolved or mitigated, the incident is closed, and team members revert to their standard roles. The incident document then serves as a foundation for the post-incident analysis.
